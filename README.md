# Sample Project

This is as an example on how teams can structure their project repositories. Thanks to Lindsey Heagey and Joachim Meyer for the template!

## Files

* `.gitignore`
<br> Globally ignored files by `git` for the project.
* `environment.yml`
<br> `conda` environment description needed to run this project.
* `README.md`
<br> Description of the project (see suggested headings below)

## Folders

### `contributors`
Each team member has it's own folder under contributors, where they can work on their contribution. Having a dedicated folder for each person helps to prevent conflicts when merging with the main branch.

### `notebooks`
Notebooks that are considered delivered results for the project should go in here.

### `scripts`
Helper utilities that are shared with the team
